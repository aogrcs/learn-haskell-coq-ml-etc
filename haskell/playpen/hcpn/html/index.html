<H2>HCPN - Haskell-Coloured Petri Nets</H2>

<P>Coloured Petri Nets are a high-level form of <A
href="http://www.daimi.au.dk/PetriNets/">Petri Nets</A> (see also this
<A
href="http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/cr3/talks/index.html#PetriNets">short
tour of Petri nets</A>), in which anonymous tokens are replaced by data
objects of some programming language (and transitions can operate on
that data, in addition to moving it around). The combination of
functional languages and Petri nets promises a rich design space - the
two formalisms have little overlap and much to offer to each other. 
</P>

<P>Coloured Petri nets with functional inscription languages are a
well-established starting point on this route, but are usually
associated with high startup costs wrt tool support. By embedding such
nets in their inscription languages, it is possible to reduce these
startup costs drastically (from years to weeks), and although the
resulting quick-start toolsets will not be able to compete with those
evolved over years, they offer a cheep and cheerful entry route. One can
get started quickly, invest more time and resources where and when
needed, and, crucially, have access to the source code for
experimentation and extension. 
</P>

<P>At IFL 1999, we outlined these ideas for the concrete example of 
Haskell-Coloured Petri nets, giving <A 
href="http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/~cr3/publications/HCPN.html">a simple embedding 
of such nets in Haskell</A>. Somewhat to our disappointment, there has so far 
not been an abundance of Haskell-, Clean-, Erlang-, .. coloured nets in 
practical use. So we've decided to follow up our outline by concrete 
prototypical tool support for Haskell-Coloured Petri nets (HCPN for short), 
hoping that others will be encouraged to follow suit for nets with
inscriptions in their favourite functional programming language (if your
favourite fpl happens to be SML, have a look at <a
  href="http://wiki.daimi.au.dk/cpntools/">CPN/Tools</a>, the successor
of <a href="http://www.daimi.au.dk/designCPN/">Design/CPN</a>). 
<P>

</P>So far, we have a bare-bones graphical editor for HCPN, building on
the portable <A href="http://wxhaskell.sourceforge.net/">wxHaskell</A>
GUI library (Haskell binding to wxWidgets). From this, HCPN can be
saved, loaded, and exported as Haskell code for graphical or textual
simulation. (HCPN NetEdit is not quite ready for prime time yet, but
functional; as long as you promise not to look at the ugly code, you can
find <a href="HCPN_04082004.tar.gz">a snapshot of version 0.1</a> here
[now updated for wxHaskell-0.8];-). 
</P>

<P>For the curious, here's a simple example, the infamous deadlocking
philosophers. First, as a plain Petri net (note that anonymous tokens
are modelled as empty products, which are elided by default from arc
labels and place types): 
</P>
<IMG alt="philosophers as a plain Petri net" src="philosophers.jpg"> 
<P> Of course, using coloured nets, we can replace the anonymous tokens
by data values, say Ints 0,1,2 for the three forks and similarly for the
three philosophers. Once we can distinguish the tokens this way, we can
fold the matching places together and, in fact, we can fold the matching
transitions as well if we calculate the forks to work with from the
philosopher number: 
</P>

<P>And here's an example textual simulation run of the latter HCPN: 
<PRE>
Mark {forks = [0,1,2], phil_ready = [0,1,2], phil_has_both = [], phil_has_right = []}
phil_takes_right
Mark {forks = [1,2], phil_ready = [0,2], phil_has_both = [], phil_has_right = [1]}
phil_takes_left
Mark {forks = [1], phil_ready = [0,2], phil_has_both = [1], phil_has_right = []}

phil_takes_right
Mark {forks = [], phil_ready = [], phil_has_both = [], phil_has_right = [2,1,0]}
no more enabled transitions!

<P>The Haskell code (here the older, slightly simpler version) generated
is fairly recognizable, but not the kind of code you'd want to write by
hand for larger nets:-)

<p>
Another, possibly more interesting example is an embedding of a
pi-calculus into HCPN. That this is possible may surprise those 
who still equate Petri nets entirely with the simple anonymous
token variant, or presume that the static nature of Petri nets
precludes the modeling of dynamic process systems, but the 
embedding is straightforward. One just has to decide which parts
of the system to be modelled are static and which are dynamic,
and of course, higher order abstract syntax using Haskell's
anonymous functions helps to cope with the binding structure of
this pi-calculus. The dynamic part is the "process soup", which
is mapped onto a multiset of process tokens on a single place,
and the static part are the reaction rules, which are mapped to
a transition per rule (as a variation, replication is mapped to 
recursion in Haskell; either way, this isn't very practical - one
would want to limit the use of replication in practice). This embedding
is not specific to the pi-calculus, but covers multiset rewrite systems
in general.
</p>
<img alt="pi-calculus as a HCPN" src="pi.jpg">
<p>
A few points to note about this example:
<ul>
  <li>the <code>communication</code> transition uses a guard to
      guarantee equality of sender and receiver channels. Permitting
      repeated variables on the set of input arcs would be more concise,
      but would complicate the embedding of HCPN in Haskell.
      </li>
  <li>this innocent-looking combination of functional programming and
      Petri net functionality nicely demonstrates the potential of this
      hybrid formalism, but was not possible in Design/CPN (token types
      had to be equality types in SML, which excluded functions, amongst
      other things).
      </li>
  <li>not restricting token types needlessly works fine for simulation
      (multisets on places will not be presented in shortest form, but
      that's a fairly minor irritation). It will, however, require
      additional thought if state space generation is intended (to
      avoid having to deal with spuriously different states).
