Patterns of Kind Abstraction (i.e., type-level programming)

Beginnings of type-level programming
- functional dependencies
- GADTs

type-level == kind-level

Outline
- Higher-order kinds
- Higher-kinded polymorphism
- Associated type synonyms
- Type (synonym) families
- Kind polymorphism
- Type promotion
- Type-level programming
- Dependently-typed programming
- Higher-order kinds

Types classify values at different levels of abstraction:

â€“- Primitive types
"a string" :: String
3          :: Int

-- instances of higher-order, parameterized types
Just 10  :: Maybe  Int
Left 10  :: Either Int b

-- functions are first class values
(* 2) :: Num a => a -> a

-- type-constructors are functions
Just :: a -> Maybe a
Left :: a -> Either a b

Kinds classify types.

For monomorphic types (i.e, not polymorphic) the kind signature is `*`:

-- TYPE         KIND
[Char]      ::   *
Maybe Int   ::   *

Parametric types express higher-order kinds, for example:

Maybe  ::  * -> *
--         a -> Maybe a

where `* -> *` is a placeholder for `a -> Maybe a`

Either       * -> * -> *
 --          a -> b -> Either a b

kinds can distinguish
- lifted types (of kind `*`)
- type constructors (e.g., `* -> * -> *`).

Kind signatures signify
- arity of parameterization of a type
- i.e., the number and position of type parameters in a type

arity says nothing about type
- kind system is untyped
