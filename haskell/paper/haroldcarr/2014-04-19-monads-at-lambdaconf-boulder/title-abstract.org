Title:

Monads : why should you care?

Abstract:

Most monad explanations use analogies like "container" or "context"
then show how monads are implemented and/or how they relate to
category theory---leaving people more confused then when they started.
This presentation will instead show the usefulness of monads---what
they can do for you (not how they work).  The aim is to motivate you
to get a glimpse of the benefits of monads such that you can use them
in your work and motivate you to understand how they work on your own.
