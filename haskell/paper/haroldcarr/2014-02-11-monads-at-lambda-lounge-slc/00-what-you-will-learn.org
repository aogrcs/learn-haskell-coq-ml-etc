* initial intuition

- a =Monad= is used to pipe the /output/ of one function into another
- a monadic "pipe" has code that executes "behind the scenes"
  - rather than embedded in main lines of program

* monads and side-effects

- a =Monad= has /nothing/ to do with "real" side-effects
  - e.g., reading/writing a file
- a monadic type is often used to simulate side-effects in a purely functional way, aka "effectful"
- the =IO= monad does "real" side-effects

* combining monads

- use monad "transformers" to combine two or more monads
