STUFF Search for:
If each step returns a success/failure indicator, you can have bind
execute the next step only if the previous one succeeded. In this way,
a failing step aborts the whole sequence "automatically", without any
conditional testing from you. (The Failure Monad.)

For the most part, you can think of the extra monadic structure as a
sequence of extra behaviors associated with a monadic value;
e.g. Maybe being "give up" for Nothing and "keep going" for
Just. Combining two monadic actions then essentially concatenates the
sequences of behaviors they held.

ME: the examples are designed to be extremely simple (and contrived)
so what stands out is the mechanics of monad operation.
